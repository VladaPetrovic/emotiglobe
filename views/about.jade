	h2 About The Globe
	p Emotiglobe is a visual representation of how the world is feeling right now. The lines drawn in specific geographic locations reveal if people are happy or sad. The bigger the line is, the more intense emotions are in that area. Red lines show negative levels of happiness and green lines positive levels.

	h2 The Algorithm
	p The app is continiously reading Twitter's live stream trying to find emoticons that reveal emotions. Although basic in its implementation it's proven to be quite accurate and the main focus is to improve the emoticon logic as the app is updated.
